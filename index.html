                            Instagram is an image and video sharing based social networking platform that was launched in October 2010 by creators Kevin
                            Systrom and Mike Krieger. It is currently owned by Facebook and had achieved one billion monthly active users in 2018. Instagram's main 
                            features include posts that allow extensive engagement, direct messaging, stories, along with newer features such as reels and IGTV.
                            Because the platform mainly caters to public sharing, businesses and influencers can utilize the "Promotions" and "Insights" tools to grow and market
                            their brands, as well as make their posts shoppable. The majority of Instagram's users land within the age range of 18-34, making it an ideal
                            place for marketing; however, revenue is limited due to the platform's mobile-only nature. The mega-social networking service's wide accessibility to 
                            the public also entails a decline in mental health through cyberbullying, depression, body image issues, etc. Instagram has since implemented various user 
                            abilities, such as private accounts and automatic filters for inappropriate comments, to counter abusive usage.

                            Snapchat is a social media messaging application that is primarily known for its vanishing feature for messages and photos. It was developed by Snap Inc.
                            and released in September 2011, roughly a year after Instagram. In February 2021, Snapchat achieved over 100 million monthly active users. The platform revolves mostly
                            around private communication and includes features that encourage messaging such as best friend emojis, streaks, and Snapchat scores and trophies. Additionally, users are allowed
                            to save their personal photos into a space that imitates a photo album, which also includes features like "Memories" and "Month Recap" that personalizes the app. This direction 
                            towards more casual, everyday content inevitably attracts a smaller, younger audience, most notably teenagers. Public interaction is limited but sponsored stories are 
                            available in the "Discover" section, along with news and entertainment stories, and a recently added feature, named "Spotlight", serves as a public forum where users can upload
                            videos.

                                Though the size and range of their users significantly differ, both Instagram and Snapchat share many similar features as two social networking services focusing on visual content.
                                The most prominent and deciding difference between these two platforms is the usage of the app that caters to a certain audience. As a public platform where users can easily see 
                                each others users' content and profiles, Instagram is a place for entertainment and professionalism, on top of massive social networking. On the other hand, Snapchat focuses 
                                on social networking primarily through multimedia messaging, which limits a variety of usages, but even still, maintains a stable, growing audience. The application is more personal and 
                                private, as it involves communication of daily life content.
